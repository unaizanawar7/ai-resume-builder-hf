**Q: How long does the entire process take?**
A: Typically 10-20 minutes for a complete resume, depending on how much information you're starting with.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes. The current version doesn't store your information permanently. Data is only held in memory during your session.

**Q: Can I use this for free?**
A: The application is free to use. However, you (or whoever set it up) need an Anthropic API key, which has costs based on usage.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**
A: No! This version works without accounts. Just start building.

### Resume Content

**Q: How long should my resume be?**
A: Aim for 1-2 pages. One page if you have less than 5 years of experience, two pages for more extensive backgrounds.

**Q: Should I include a photo?**
A: In the US, generally no. In some countries (Europe, Asia), it's common. Check local customs.

**Q: What if I don't have quantifiable achievements?**
A: Ask the AI Career Coach! It can help you identify metrics you might have overlooked or suggest ways to describe impact.

A: AI processing can take 10-30 seconds for complex operations. If it takes longer than a minute, refresh and try again.

**Q: Can I go back and change my layout choice?**
A: Currently, you'd need to start over. Save your resume data and it'll be quick to rebuild with a new layout.

**Q: The exported PDF doesn't look quite right. What should I do?**
A: Download the text version and copy it into your preferred document editor for final formatting touches.

A: The AI analyzes your experience level, industry, skills, and target role against thousands of successful resumes to provide tailored advice.

**Q: Will the AI write my resume for me?**
A: The AI enhances and optimizes your content, but it needs your real information and experiences. It makes what you provide better.
